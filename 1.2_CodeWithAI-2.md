## Step by step Coding 
* 1.write a image viewer with PyQt for me, with two panels, the layout is left and right.

* 2.right panel displays the chosen image from the list.
set the default directory to "C:\AI\ChatGPT_presentation\ImageGenarate"

3. add a button to the left panel, which lets me to choose the image directory

4. make the with of these two panels adjustable

5. give me 5 buttons in a row, below the image label. layout them tight together
each meaning 1-5 star rating of current image, remember this rating in self.image_ratings

* 1. the left panel (30% of the window width) showing image list, add a button to "left panel", which lets me to choose the image directory,
right panel displays the chosen image from the list.
set the default directory to "C:\AI\ChatGPT_presentation\ImageGenarate"

-- the layout is not left and right, correct it

7. add "Weather" menu , its action is opening a popup window

8. inside the "Weather" window, call a weather API ,and display the weather of BeiJing, add error handling.
<!-- 
auto resize the image to 90% of the panel size in the right when the panel width is changed. -->
9. set the background of right panel to deep gray

10. set weather_label to a  bigger font size and blue
