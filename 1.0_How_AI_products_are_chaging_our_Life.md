<H3 style="color: #09c">ChatGPT is a large language model (LLM) that has been trained to carry on dialogue. What does that mean?</h3>

## Language Model

Language models are machine learning models that are trained on how to continue a sentence. So, I were to say:

        At the stroke

the model tells me probable ways in which that sentence continues. Perhaps, it is:

        At the stroke of midnight [70%]

        At the stroke of a pen [30%]

This is because the language model has been shown enough text — speeches, articles, books, articles, reviews, etc. — and it has learned what words are likely to follow others.

## Memorization and generalization
LLMs learn word continuations in different contexts.
